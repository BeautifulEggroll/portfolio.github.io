      <h2>Looking Back and Moving Forward</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I’ve grown a lot—both as a student and as someone who enjoys sharing knowledge with others. One of the most rewarding moments came when I helped teach two siblings how to code Java using Minecraft. Seeing them get excited as they created their own commands and features reminded me how powerful curiosity and learning can be. I’ve developed stronger communication and leadership skills by mentoring robotics students and organizing STEM events, and I've learned how to work through challenges with confidence.

        My favorite moment in robotics was when our team received the Inspire Award and made it through ILT. That moment captured all the late nights, team effort, and resilience we had built together. Looking ahead, I hope to keep inspiring others—whether it’s through engineering, design, or education. I want to explore more about how technology can be used to improve lives and continue finding new ways to challenge myself while lifting up those around me.
